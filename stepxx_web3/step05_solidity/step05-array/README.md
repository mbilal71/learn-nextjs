# Fixed and Dynamic size array

Fixed - define fixed size of array at compile time
Dynamic - Size can be changed

# Byte array

1 byte = 8 bits
1 hexadecimal digit = 4 bits
Everything that will be stored in the byte array will be in the form of hexadecimal digits.

Points:

- byte array can not be modified
- Padding of 0 is added at the end if the value (by which the array is initialized) does not occupy the entire space e.g byte2 b2='a' //'6100'
