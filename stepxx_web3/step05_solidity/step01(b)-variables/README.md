# state variable

permanently store variable in blockchai, declare outside of function and require gas fees.
unit age;
automatically values saves in this variable
To change value of state variable:

- using the contracts constructor.
- initializing the variable at declaration
- using the setter function.

# local variable

these variable store in stack not in contract storage
string name="hira"
this name variable cannot store in stack and if we want to declare in function we will add memory to store it in memory.
string memory name="hira

Points:

- Dont't cost gas.
- memory keyword can not be used at contract
- by default varible is private

- A data type helps us determine the memory requirements for the variable
